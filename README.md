# WiiUDownloader
Allows to download encrypted wiiu files from Nintendo's official servers

## Features
- Multiplatform (Windows, macOS and Linux)
- Nice UI
- Queue for title download
- Title filtering (Games, Updates, DLCs and Demos)
- Uses same Title Database as NUSspli, so it has the same titles as NUSspli
- Allows for decryption of titles after download

## TODO
- Better queue management and overall UI

## Thanks to:
- V10lator for a lot of inspiration, code and hosting and providing the Title Database
- Morilli for the original WiiUDownloader
- VitaSmith for their CDecrypt fork
